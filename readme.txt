# Description

I created a user interactive Quiz web application using html, css, javascript. On visiting the web app it user can start the quiz. Quiz contains multiple choice questions which comes one after one. User can select from options available on the screen for the particular question and on correct answer it turns green and turns red on wrong answer. After one question user can move to next question. In the end it asks the user to restart the quiz.
